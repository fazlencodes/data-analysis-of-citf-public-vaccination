# data-analysis-of-citf-public-vaccination

I have used vaccionation by states, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fazlencodes/citf-public/main/vaccination/vax_state.csv which was uploaded by CITF-Malaysia on github. 
A simple plot was made by using matplotlib to visualize the cumulative of total doses for every states in Malaysia.
